  <h1>Complecated Recipies. But Not Really</h1>

  <p>Cooking can be really hard, especially if you are really bad at it. But for those people who don't care if you burn your house down, here are some recipies you probably shouldn't start with:</p>

  <h3>
    <ul>  
      <li><a href="bacon"> Bacon and Brie Fettuccine</a></li>
      <li><a href="pesto"> Pistachio Pesto Pasta</a></li>
    </ul> 
  </h3>

      <p>They all say it should take about 30 minutes, they're lying it will take two hours.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To make your pistachio pesto, add your fresh basil, toasted pistachio pieces, fresh lemon juice, garlic, nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (optional). Pulse until combined but not completely smooth, scraping down a few times in between.<br>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong> Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while pulsing until combined and desired texture is achieved.<br>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong> In a large pot, boil water with a pinch of salt. Add you penne and cook until al dente. Drain and rinse your cooked pasta and add it back to the pot.<br>
    <strong>Step 4:</strong> Add your pistachio pesto, artichokes, cherry tomato halves, and greens. Stir until combined and warm over medium heat for a few minutes.<br>
    <strong>Step 5:</strong> Serve your pistachio pesto pasta topped with more pistachio pieces, nutritional yeast/parmesan, and/or red pepper flakes.<br>
    <strong>Step 6:</strong> TOAST YOUR PISTACHIOS: To toast your shelled pistachios, spread them evenly on a baking sheet, bake at 350°F for about 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they’re golden and aromatic. *Watch them closely so they don’t burn.<br>
