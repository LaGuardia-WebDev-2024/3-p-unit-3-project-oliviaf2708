  <h1>Complecated Recipies. But Not Really</h1>

  <p>Cooking can be really hard, especially if you are really bad at it. But for those people who don't care if you burn your house down, here are some recipies you probably shouldn't start with:</p>

  <h3>
    <ul>  
      <li><a href="https://www.food.com/recipe/fettuccine-with-brie-and-bacon-sauce-44245"> Bacon and Brie Fettuccine</a>->Here</li>
      <li><a href="https://naturallieplantbased.com/pistachio-pesto-pasta/#recipe"> Pistachio Pesto Pasta</a>->Here</li>
      <li>Whatever you have in your fridge</li>
    </ul> 
  </h3>

      <p>They all say it should take about 30 minutes, they're lying it will take two hours.</p>
